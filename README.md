# K-Means-Clustering-101-World-Happiness
In this case study, we will train an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to cluster countries based on features such as economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. The World Happiness Report determines the state of global happiness. The happiness scores and rankings data has been collected by asking individuals to rank their life from 0 (worst possible life) to 10 (best possible life).
In this course, we are going to focus on the following learning objectives:

Understand how to leverage the power of machine learning to perform unsupervised segmentation

Apply Python libraries to import and visualize dataset images.

Learn how to use Plotly to visualize geographical data

Understand the theory and intuition behind k-means clustering machine learning algorithm

Learn how to obtain the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method

Apply Scikit-Learn library to find the optimal number of clusters using elbow method

Apply k-means in Scikit-Learn to perform segmentation
